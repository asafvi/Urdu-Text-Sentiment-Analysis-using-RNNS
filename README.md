# Urdu-Text-Sentiment-Analysis-using-RNNS
Implemented a urdu text sentiment analysis model that takes an urdu sentence as an input and predicts the sentiment associated with the sentence (whether it has a positive connotation or negative). Done via Tensorflow, using a combination of a CNN and GRU RNN. IEEE format report included.

Sentiment analysis aims to identify the sentiment expressed in textual data. In this paper, we focus on Urdu text sentiment analysis using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Urdu is a widely spoken language in South Asia, and analyzing sentiment in Urdu text can be valuable for various applications such as validating public opinion on certain topics by simply scanning through texts.

The goal is to develop a model capable of accurately
predicting sentiment (positive or negative) from Urdu text.
This involves:
• Acquiring a dataset of Urdu text with sentiment labels.
• Implementing an RNN-based model for sentiment anal-
